# visual-rep-of-mult--fork4b-sequence-facts
visual representations of times tables students see pic, name the fact.   figure out how many things ther eare. We'll build them alter. 


And I am officially not impressed with repl.it  -- twice in two days, people, I have clicked to push and commit, and it pretended that it happened but later on too bad so sad.   It's "hey, put this on GitHub!!"

okay, then of its own volition it seems to have done a merge so I can get things now but ... what?   I think I don't want to be a beta tester.
